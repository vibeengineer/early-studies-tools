Hi [recipient_name],

I'm heading to the IIEX Conference in DC next week and was looking through attendee backgrounds when I came across your profile. I'm the co-founder of Early Studies, where we've been developing some interesting approaches to [personalized_research_area_relevant_to_recipient] that seem relevant to the consumer insights work you're leading at [recipient_company].

Are you planning to attend IIEX this year? If so, I'd love to grab coffee between sessions if you have 15 minutes. I'm particularly interested in hearing about [specific interest based on recipient profile].

If you're not making it to DC this time, I'd still be happy to connect virtually sometime - I've been following [mention something specific about their work/company], and it looks like we're tackling similar questions from different angles.

Cheers,
Sam

Hi [recipient_name],

Just a quick note as IIEX approaches next week - wondering if you'll be there? I'm particularly looking forward to the [specific session/topic] session that seems aligned with [reference their work/interests].

I'll be [mention your availability/location, e.g., at the Innovations Showcase from 2-4pm on Wednesday] if you're around and have time for a quick hello. And if you're not making it to DC this year, I'd still be interested in hearing your thoughts on [mention relevant Early Studies topic] - perhaps a brief call in May?

All the best,
Sam

Hi [recipient_name],

Whether we managed to connect at IIEX or not (the conference was a bit of a whirlwind this year!), I wanted to share a quick thought that might interest you.

That panel discussion with [Specific Speaker] on [Specific Topic] really hit home. Their point about [Specific Point] aligns with what we've been seeing in our own research. I was particularly struck by the data showing [Specific Data Point, e.g., a 34% increase in engagement...].

I made some rough notes on [Related Topic] - happy to share them if it's relevant to what you're working on at [recipient_company]. No fancy presentation, just some observations that might save you time.

Enjoy the rest of your week,
Sam

Hi [recipient_name],

I came across [mention recent news/article about recipient_company or industry] yesterday - looks like an interesting direction, especially with [mention specific aspect].

It reminded me of some research we just wrapped up at Early Studies on [related research topic]. One finding surprised us: [Specific Data Point, e.g., 72% of our Gen Z panel said they actively research...].

We've compiled the full dataset showing [mention dataset details]. Happy to share it if it would be helpful for your team's work on [relate to their initiative].

How's [mention their initiative or a related topic] being received so far? Always curious to hear how these campaigns are landing in the real world.

Best,

Hi [recipient_name],

Hope your [mention timely event, e.g., Q2 planning] is going smoothly. I remembered our brief chat about [mention topic] when I was reviewing a project we just completed.

We worked with a [company type, e.g., retailer] (similar size to [recipient_company]) that was seeing [describe challenge, e.g., steadily declining response rates on their post-purchase surveys].

We helped them redesign their approach using [describe approach 1] and [describe approach 2]. The most effective change was [mention key change].

[Time frame, e.g., Six weeks in], their [metric 1] [result 1, e.g., response rate jumped to 18%], and they were [result 2, e.g., capturing input from...].

Have you been experimenting with anything similar at [recipient_company]? I'm curious if you've found other approaches that work well.

Cheers,
Sam
